# Algos
Python implementations of various fundamental CS algorithms I saw in my Algorithms class at Purdue or see often in coding interviews. Basically a personal study guide and way to practice Python. Will keep adding to these as I figure more out.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions of think something that should be added/changed.
