# Algos
Python implementations of various fundamental CS algorithms I saw in my Algorithms class at Purdue, see often in coding interviews, or think are interesting. Basically a personal study guide and way for me to stay sharp with Python and algorithms. Will keep adding to these as I figure more out and keep interview prepping.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or think of something that should be added/changed.
